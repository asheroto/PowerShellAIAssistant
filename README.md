> **Note**: If you have `PowerShellAI` you can safely `PowerShellAIAssistant` using `-AllowClobber`

```powershell
Install-Module PowerShellAIAssistant -AllowClobber
```

Example code accomplishing common tasks with the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction). To run these [examples](./examples/)

## Setup
First, create an [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/signup) or [sign in](https://platform.openai.com/login). Next, navigate to the [API key page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and "Create new secret key", optionally naming the key. Make sure to save this somewhere safe and do not share it with anyone.

Run the [Sanity-Check](/examples/Sanity-Check.ps1) script first. You need the API key to run it. It creates and deletes a assistant on the backend. If it works, you're good to go.

> Note: `Get-OAIAssistant` requires PowerShell 7.4 or higher. It needs the `AllowInsecureRedirect` parameter, a workaround is being investigated.

If you don't have PowerShell 7.4 or higher, you can use CodeSpaces to run the example. Click the button below to open CodeSpaces.

----

Welcome to `PowerShell AI Assistant`, a module designed for seamless integration with `OpenAI Assistant` APIs, providing a rich set of functionalities to empower your PowerShell scripts with the latest AI technologies. Dive into an enhanced scripting experience by leveraging an AI-powered assistant in your console.

## Why PowerShell AI Assistant?

`PowerShell AI Assistant` is where advanced AI meets PowerShell scripting. With this module, you can create interactive, intelligent scripts and applications that understand and process natural language with ease.

## Examples

There is one example and it is in a Polyglot Interactive Notebook.

[Assistants API overview](examples/Assistants_API_overview.ipynb) - this notebook shows how to use the Assistants API to build a simple question answering interaction.

## Features

- Easy integration with OpenAI's Assistants API
- Build conversational AI models within PowerShell
- Access a suite of AI capabilities for natural language processing, understanding, and decision making
- Extend your automation scripts with smart AI assistant features
